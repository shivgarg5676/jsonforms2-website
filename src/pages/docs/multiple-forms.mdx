# Multiple Forms

There are use cases where multiple forms should be embedded into a single page. This section 
describes some of these in more detail.

## Linking forms

Forms can interact with each other by using `$ref` and setting the `scope` property within the UI schema
accordingly. In this example, we have two entities, Person and Address. Whenever we change
the `shippingAddress` property of the person, it is subsequently updated in the address form and vice versa.

<LinkedForms />

## Independent forms
There might be use cases where you have forms that do not have anything in common, so your forms are independent, although they share the same store. In such cases
you can explicitly pass  `schema` and `uischema` props to the `JsonFormsDispatch` component
(if you don't specify these, they will be fetched from the store).

Additionally, the `JsonFormsDispatch` component also takes a `path` prop which specifies
the instance path that is used to bind against the data.

To illustrate, let's look again at the example from before, but this time
the `person` and `address` schemas are not stored in any common parent schema.

<MultipleForms />

The code for the above example looks as follows:

```
<div>
  <JsonFormsDispatch schema={personSchema}
             uischema={personUISchema}
             renderers={materialRenderers}
  />
  <JsonFormsDispatch schema={addressSchema}
             uischema={addressUISchema}
             renderers={materialRenderers}
  />
</div>
```

As you can see we explicitly pass in the `schema` and `uischema` props.
We also need to specify which property the data should be written to, in this case we
use `person` and `shippingAddress`.

If you are interested in using JSON Forms witout Redux, see more details in the [React integration](/docs/react) section.
